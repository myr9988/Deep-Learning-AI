    "Indoor places, such as restaurants and grocery stores, are legally required to have rules in place for the mandatory use of face masks. Having a worker manually examining each person to make sure their mask is on simply defeats the goal of limiting contact with people as much as possible. So, a real-time face mask detection system can be used to address this issue that will not only maximize efficiency but will also ensure to potentially save lives.\n",

    "The goal of a face mask detection system is to create an image recognition system that understands how image classification works, and it should work with great accuracy so that our model can be applied in the realtime situations. It will work by recognizing the boundaries of the face and predicting whether or not you are wearing a face mask in real-time."
